This project will be my first step to be a Front_End Developer while im learning JavaScript from STARTER to EXPERT! As a Self Taught developer i need to build so much projects so i will start from ZERO to ONE and for that i will start to build a calculator with JS as an easy idea it will be a simple one using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The calculator will do just simple operations as addition, division, multiplication and subtraction.
